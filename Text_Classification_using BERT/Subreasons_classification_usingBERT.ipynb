Although I had spend over \\\\u00a3100. A member of staff also tried to help us (after having to wait for at least 10mins!) and they weren\\'t able to sort it. I think that this is appalling. And for your information, all my shopping was within the terms and conditions and the offer still had 3 days left to use by. (The employee also saw this and agreed with us) Also I have a free tote bag reward, which according to another member of staff, hasn\\'t been available for over 3 months. That aside, it was also very difficult to get the products I needed as there were a lot of staff unloading stock to stack the shelves. This made it difficult for both myself (and other customers) and your staff. Having stock trolleys in the middle of aisles didn\\'t make it easy to look for my usual items and possibly other items I would\\'ve liked to have tried, if I could see them! With the Christmas season, it would be wise to have more available staff at the checkouts to help customers. We had issues at the self checkout tills and had to stand around for at least 10mins, along with other customers who were also getting frustrated. When the 1 member of staff finally arrived, they were flustered, and this was only around 8.30am!

Purchased a cashmere cardigan and had to order the matching crew neck jumper whilst in store. 6 items available. Order confirmation received. Some hours later, I am emailed to say the item has been cancelled and yet it still shows as 1 in stock on your website. I would not choose to shop in store during these times but had to do this today to purchase the items required. I now find myself with a cardigan and not a matching jumper. This leaves me again having to put myself at increased risk and return in store for a refund. Order no 306-0017655-8922221. Is there any way this cashmere jumper can be sourced to save me having to return the cardigan in store. Happy to be contacted at allyson@thewrens.co.uk.

Of course, all was well. i checked the gift card status and it still has about \\\\u00a383 left on it. my only suggestion would be to, perhaps, add a little message, just to say, \\\\\"you\\'ve used this \\\\u00a3[xxx.xx], but you have this \\\\u00a3[xxx.xx] left on your giftcard\\\\\" after applying the card.
